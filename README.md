When I am not developing software, I enjoy hiking, skiing, and playing with my lab named Moose.

# Projects
Here you can find school projects I created during my time at Baylor as well as a few personal projects of mine. These personal projects are in various states of development so I make no guarantees about their use :)

Here are two personal projects I would like to highlight:
+ [Snake](https://github.com/i-laird/Snake): Originally a two player group project I worked on for my intro to software development course, I am reimagining it as a multiplayer game where there is no cap on the number of players being serviced by the server. There will be the ability to have one server host multiple 2-8 player games at the same time. I am using both synchronous and asynchronous network i/o in this.
+ [Derivation Solver](https://github.com/i-laird/Derivation_Solver) A derivation solver whose scope has gradually increased as I have worked on it. Originally intended to be a CLI based derivation solver, I have shifted gears and now creating a RESTful application that will serve a calculator UI I have yet to create. While the derivation solver already can handle many cases, I still sometimes find edge cases that result in incorrect derivatives. If you find one of these please let me know! Be sure to check out the [parser](https://github.com/i-laird/Derivation_Solver/blob/master/src/main/java/DerivationSolver/Parser.java) I wrote for this project.

Here are 2 School Projects I would like to highlight:
+ [Tiger Game](https://github.com/i-laird/Tiger_Game) This was the group project for Intro to Algorithms at Baylor University. The game has two rows of men whose goal is to trap the tiger (tiger cannot move). The men can only move along one edge at a time, but the tiger can jump over a man to kill him. This project implements the AI for both men and the tiger. This men AI was the only men AI in the class to capture an enemy team's tiger.
+ [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/i-laird/Sentiment_Analyzer) This was the group project for my Natural Language Processing class at Baylor University. This project uses machine learning as well as natural language processing to determine how a collection of reviews of a product are rating this product. The way it does this is by identifying the topics that are common across the reviews and then determining if a review is positive or negative regarding this topic.
