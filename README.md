# About me
I recently graduated from Baylor University in Waco, Texas with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am originally from Bozeman, Montana, which is where I am currently located as I work from home at Capital One. Once I return to the office I will be located in Plano, Texas. In January I begin at Georgia Tech in their OMSCS program.

When I am not developing software, I enjoy rock climbing, reading, and playing Age of Empires 2.

Here you can find school projects I created during my time at Baylor as well as a few personal projects of mine. These personal projects are in various states of development so I make no guarantees about their use :)

Here are two personal projects that I am currently working on:
+ [Snake](https://github.com/i-laird/Snake): Originally a two player group project I worked on for my intro to software development course, I am reimagining it as a multiplayer game where there is no cap on the number of players being serviced by a server that I am writing. There will be the ability to have one server host multiple 2-8 player games at the same time.
+ [Derivation Solver](https://github.com/i-laird/Derivation_Solver) A derivation solver whose scope has gradually increased as I have worked on it. Originally intended to be a CLI based derivation solver, I have shifted gears and now creating a RESTful application that will serve a calculator UI I have yet to create. While the derivation solver already can handle many cases, I still have some work to do in order to evaluate complex expressions. Be sure to check out the [parser](https://github.com/i-laird/Derivation_Solver/blob/master/src/main/java/DerivationSolver/Parser.java) I wrote for this project.

Here are a couple of my favorite school projects:
+ [Tiger Game](https://github.com/i-laird/Tiger_Game) This was the group project for Intro to Algorithms at Baylor University. The game has two rows of men whose goal is to trap the tiger (tiger cannot move). The men can only move along one edge at a time, but the tiger can jump over a man to kill him. This project implements the AI for both men and the tiger. This men AI was the only men AI in the class to capture an enemy team's tiger.
+ [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/i-laird/Sentiment_Analyzer) This was the group project for my Natural Language Processing class at Baylor University. This project uses machine learning as well as natural language processing to determine how a collection of reviews of a product are rating this product. The way it does this is by identifying the topics that are common across the reviews and then determining if a review is positive or negative regarding this topic.
