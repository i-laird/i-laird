# About me
I recently graduated from Baylor University in Waco, Texas with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am originally from Bozeman, Montana, which is where I am currently located as I work from home at Capital One. Once I return to the office I will be located in Plano, Texas. In January I begin at Georgia Tech in their OMSCS program.

When I am not developing software, I enjoy rock climbing, reading, and playing Age of Empires 2.

Here you can find school projects I created during my time at Baylor as well as a few personal projects of mine. These personal projects are in various states of development so I make no guarantees about their use :)

Here are the two projects that I am currently working on:
+ [Snake](https://github.com/i-laird/Snake): Originally a two player group project I worked on for my intro to software development course, I am reimagining it as a multiplayer game where there is no cap on the number of players being serviced by a server that I am writing. There will be the ability to have one server host multiple 2-8 player games at the same time.
+ [Derivation Solver](https://github.com/i-laird/Derivation_Solver) A derivation solver whose scope has gradually increased as I have worked on it. Originally intended to be a CLI based derivation solver, I have shifted gears and now creating a RESTful application that will serve a calculator UI I have yet to create. While the derivation solver already can handle many cases, I still have some work to do in order to evaluate complex expressions. Be sure to check out the [parser](https://github.com/i-laird/Derivation_Solver/blob/master/src/main/java/DerivationSolver/Parser.java) I wrote for this project in order to create the syntax tree.
